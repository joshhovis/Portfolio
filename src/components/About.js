            <p>
                Hi, I'm Joshua, a front-end software developer from the United
                States.
            </p>
            <p>My primary tools of choice include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>Astro</li>
                <li>Nodejs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I am passionate about building things. Whether
                that is a new table or an entire additional room being added to
                a house. I love building things from the ground up, taking a
                plan and executing it until it is finished. Building a website
                from the ground up gives me the same satisfaction as building a
                kitchen table from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I have my preferred tools, I always choose the best one
                for the job, even if its something I have yet to master and need
                more reinforcement in. My goal is to find the right solution for
                each project
            </p>
